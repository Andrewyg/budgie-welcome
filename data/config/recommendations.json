Even though it was initially developed just for different Ubuntu platforms, currently it work in many other GNU/Linux distributions. It will help application developers to provide a unified package that can work on different platforms. By using snap package format, applications can have their own version of libraries and there is no need to worry about libraries installed in underlying operating system. Snap packages enable developers to bring much newer versions of apps to <span name=\"distro-name\"></span>. Newer versions of KDE, GNOME, browser or other desktop environment apps will usually build easily on older LTS releases but the complexities of packaging and providing updates have prevented us from delivering them in the past.",
