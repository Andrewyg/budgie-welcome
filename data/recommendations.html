            <strong>Snap</strong> is a new generation application packaging format developed by <em>Canonical</em>.
            Even though it was initially developed just for different Ubuntu platforms, currently it work in many
            other GNU/Linux distributions. It will help application developers to provide a unified package that
            can work on different platforms. By using snap package format, applications can have their own version
            of libraries and there is no need to worry about libraries installed in underlying operating system.
            Snap packages enable developers to bring much newer versions of apps to <span name="distro-name"></span>.
            Newer versions of KDE, GNOME, browser or other desktop environment apps will usually build easily on 
            older LTS releases but the complexities of packaging and providing updates have prevented us from
            delivering them in the past.

            <h3>Search for Available Snap Packages</h3>
            <p>To see a list of all available packages in the store, open a terminal and run the following command:</p>
            <div class="code">$ snap find</div>
            <p>To search for a specific package by name, just add your search term to the end of the snap find command:</p>
            <div class="code">$ snap find name</div>
            <p>For a more complete search–searching package descriptions as well as package names–just pipe the output of 
            the snap find command through the grep filtering tool, like so:</p>
            <div class="code">$ snap find | grep search</div>
            
            <h3>How to Install a Snap Package</h3>
            <p>To install a Snap package, use the following command, specifying the package by name. Because this makes
            changes to the system, you have to add a sudo before the command to run it with root privileges.</p>
            <div class="code">$ sudo snap install package-name</div>
            <p>The snap command will download and install the snap package you specified, displaying the progress in the
            terminal window.</p>
            <p>You can launch the application you installed like any other application. If it’s a graphical application, 
            it should appear in your desktop’s applications menu. Otherwise, just start typing the application’s name at 
            the terminal and press the “Tab” key to automatically complete it. You can then press Enter to launch the 
            application or run the command you installed.</p>

            <h3>How to Update Snaps</h3>
            <p>To update an installed Snap package, run the following command, specifying the package’s name. If a new
            version of the Snap is available, it will be downloaded and installed.</p>
            <div class="code">$ sudo snap refresh package-name</div>
            <p>There doesn’t appear to be a command that updates all installed Snaps at the moment, but we wouldn’t be
            surprised to see one added in the future.</p>

            <h3>How to List Your Installed Snaps</h3>
            <p>To list your installed Snap packages, run the following command</p>
            <div class="code">$ snap list</div>
            <p>You can use this command to search your installed packages, too–just pipe the output through grep again:</p>
            <div class="code">$ snap list | grep search</div>

            <h3>How to Remove a Snap Package</h3>
            <p>To remove an installed Snap package from your computer, run the following command:</p>
            <div class="code">$ sudo snap remove package-name</div>

            <strong>Steam</strong> is a digital distribution platform developed by Valve Corporation 
            offering digital rights management (DRM), multiplayer gaming and social networking services. 
            Steam provides the user with installation and automatic updating of games on multiple computers,
            and community features such as friends lists and groups, cloud saving, and in-game voice
            and chat functionality. The software provides a freely available application programming
            interface (API) called Steamworks, which developers can use to integrate many of Steam's
            functions into their products, including networking, matchmaking, in-game achievements, 
            micro-transactions, and support for user-created content through Steam Workshop.
